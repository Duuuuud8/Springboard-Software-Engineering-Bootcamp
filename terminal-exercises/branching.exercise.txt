1. git checkout -b mybranch
2. A fast-forward merge is a straight line from one commit to the next and there is no divergence, it is on the same branch. Recursive combines different commits from different branches together.
3. git checkout mybranch or git switch mybranch
4. git branch -d mybranch
5. This happens when there is contradicting info on the same lines of files being merged, where edits are overlapping and git cannot figure out which one to go with.
